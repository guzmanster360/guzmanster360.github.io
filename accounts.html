                    essays explores who built the Opera House and the use of specific materials in its construction. Also

                <p>The artist Panda Bear had recently performed at the Syndey Opera House at the time of the interview. He discusses the nature of his 
                music. He claims that he likes to make his music a bit vague and confusing so that the listener has to put in work
                to understand the music. He doesn't like to be put on a pedestal and he prefers to be part of a group of 
                people rather than a celebrity or outcast. Panda Bear's music is derived from his desire to listen to music that makes you feel something
                which is very similar to architecture as it can also elicit emotions in the viewer.[6]</p>
