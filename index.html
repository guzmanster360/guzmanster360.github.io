                <h1>Purpose for Construction</h1>
                <div>
                    <p>According to Joseph Cahill 
                        the Sydney Opera House was built to establish 
                        a better and 
                        more enlightened community through their
                        exposure to various artists and performers. The
                        massive structure was built to be Australia's hub for
                        any and all performing arts. The founders of the building
                        wanted it constructed urgently as they were a largely immigrant
                        nation looking to define themselves.[2]

            <div class="program">
                <h1>Program</h1>
                <div>
                    <p>The program of the Sydney Opera House is to provide 
                        people with a space to fully experience the magnificence
                        of the performing arts that occur in the building. The Opera
                        House can be used for multiple purposes such as hosting concerts,
                        ballets, stage plays, film screenings, and smaller musical performances.
                        In the outside venue numerous outdoor performances also occur.[3]</p>

            <div class="users">
                <h1>Users of the Building</h1>
                <div>
                    <p>The primary users of the Opera House are as the name states:
                        Opera singers. However, a myriad of other performing arts groups
                        utilize the space to share their talent with the massive audiences
                        that frequent the building almost year round.
                    </p>
                    <p> The secondary users of the Opera House are actually tourists, as 
                        the Sydney Opera House is now Autralia's largest tourist attraction
                        bringing millions people from all around the world to witness the 
                        the brilliant shows that occur in this legendary space.[2]
