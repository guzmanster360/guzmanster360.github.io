                <p>The Sydney Opera House is an icon of Australia that took over a decade of construction and extreme engineering to produce.
                    Jorn Utzon won a design competition for an opera group that needed a new space to perform. Initial budget of 7 million Austrailian
                    dollars was very optimistic since the resultant budget was a 102 million Austrailian dollars. This was due to 
                    an unfinished design plan as construction began. The lack of completed proposals greatly delayed construction. The builders had no idea how to 
                    economically design the shells of the building. Eventually they decided to treat each shell as sections of one sphere that could be supported
                    by arches of various lengths made by similar mold. Over one million white and cream tiles make up the shells. Utzon actually left Australia before he could see
                    his building created.[Vid 2]

                <h1>Sydney Opera House: A Detailed Guide</h1>
                <p>According to the blog writer the white shells of the building beautifully contrast the vibrant blue water of the Sydney Bay. They say it 
                    has a naturalistic appearance that is remnant of some massive ancient shell. The building is at the edge of Royal 
                    Botanical gardens adding more to the naturalist feeling of the building since it isn't engulfed by urbanization. I agree with the author of this 
                    blog because there is definitely a naturalistic feeling associated with the Sydney Opera House when I observe it. The building seems part of the
                    landscape as it resembles a beached clam which usually lie at the intersection of land and sea just how the Sydney Opera House does.[7]</p>
